# Command: User Guide Generator Workflow (/command-user-guide)

This command skill automates the creation and maintenance of end-user documentation with real application screenshots in compliance with [user-guide-with-screenshots](../user-guide-with-screenshots/SKILL.md).

---

## Core Principles (User-First)

1. **Non-Technical Language**: Avoid developer jargon (e.g., _API, DTO, Endpoint, Database, State, Component, Payload_). Explain features plainly as if talking to an everyday user (e.g., use "popup window" instead of "modal").
2. **100% Real Screenshots (MANDATORY - NO TEXT-ONLY WORKAROUNDS)**: Capture images directly from the running web application (`localhost:5173`). Never use fabricated mockups or write text-only guides for features with UI changes.
3. **Visual Annotations & Red Highlights (Red Highlights `#EF4444` & Badges ①, ②, ③)**:
   - Every screenshot **MUST FEATURE VIBRANT RED HIGHLIGHTS** (`outline: 3.5px solid #EF4444; box-shadow: 0 0 0 7px rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.3)`) bounding the target button, input, or container.
   - Attach a circular red numbered badge (**①, ②, ③**) with bold white text at the top-left corner of the highlighted element.
   - In the guide text, every instructional bullet point must explicitly reference the corresponding badge number (e.g. `① Click the button...`, `② Enter the term...`).
4. **Visual Clarity**: 1 user action = 1 clear annotated screenshot + 1–2 concise explanatory sentences.
5. **File Locations**:
   - Document: `docs/user-guides/<slug>.md`
   - Images: `docs/user-guides/images/<slug>/` or `docs/user-guides/assets/<slug>/`

## 5-Step Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Feature & Scope

1. Determine the `<slug>` of the target feature from command arguments (e.g. `/command-user-guide card-creation`) or recent UI changes in `apps/web/src/features/<feature>/`.
2. Identify key screens, popups, and the main user flow (Happy path: navigate to page -> click action -> fill inputs -> confirm & save).

### Step 2: Verify Running Application

1. Check if the Web Dev Server is running at `http://localhost:5173`.
2. If not running, start the dev server (`pnpm --filter web dev`).

### Step 3: Plan & Capture Screenshots

1. Create a temporary screenshot plan (e.g., `.agents/skills/user-guide-with-screenshots/scripts/<slug>-plan.json`).
2. Run the automated Playwright capture script:
   ```bash
   node .agents/skills/user-guide-with-screenshots/scripts/capture-screenshots.mjs .agents/skills/user-guide-with-screenshots/scripts/<slug>-plan.json
   ```
   _(Or use the browser tool to capture screenshots for each step into `docs/user-guides/images/<slug>/`)_.

### Step 4: Author User Guide Document

Create or update `docs/user-guides/<slug>.md` following the standard template:

```markdown
# 📖 User Guide: [Feature Name]

> **Audience:** WordStreak Learners  
> **Last Updated:** [Current Date]
