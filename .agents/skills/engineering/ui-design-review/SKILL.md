  Use as the independent visual and design review step whenever a UI slice has
  been implemented — whether inside implementation-orchestrator's Stage 4 review
  or run on its own — and needs a fresh, adversarial look before shipping.
  Executes dual passes: Pass A (Design System, Aesthetics & Anti-AI-Slop standards)
  and Pass B (Spec fidelity against user stories, state coverage, and accessibility).
  Operates strictly read-only; fixes route back through the implementing slice.

# UI Design Review

A Phase 4 companion skill — extends `implementation-orchestrator`'s Stage 4
(Independent review) for the UI layer specifically. Read-only and
fresh-context by design: it must never be run by the same context/subagent
that implemented the slice, or it just reproduces the implementer's own
blind spots, the same reasoning `spec-validator` and Stage 4 already apply
to specs and code.

See `/README.md` for the shared file conventions this skill reuses, and
`skills/design-taste-frontend/SKILL.md` / `skills/design-taste-product/SKILL.md`
for the two generation-time skills this one reviews against.

## 1. Determine which surface this is

Check the feature's `00-intake.md` and `03-domain-model.md` §6 for what kind
of UI this is:

| Surface                                                                                                     | Rubric to use                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Landing page, marketing site, portfolio, public redesign                                                    | `design-taste-frontend`'s own rubric                                                             |
| App screens: dashboards, study/review flow, deck management, settings — anything multi-step or data-bearing | `design-taste-product`'s own rubric — `design-taste-frontend` explicitly excludes these surfaces |
| Mixed (e.g. a marketing site plus in-app screens in the same feature)                                       | Split the review; apply each rubric to its own screens, don't blend them                         |

## 2. Read the owning skill fresh, don't duplicate

Whichever surface this is, read the matching skill's own checklist **fresh,
each time** — don't copy either checklist into this file or into memory,
since a copy will drift out of sync with the source the next time that skill
is edited. Run it adversarially: this review's entire value is fresh eyes,
not re-confirming the generating agent's own self-report of the same
checklist.

- **Landing/marketing/portfolio surfaces** — read `design-taste-frontend`
  Section 9 (AI Tells) and Section 14 (Final Pre-Flight Check).
- **Product UI surfaces** — read `design-taste-product` Section 10 (AI Tells
  Specific to Product UI — plus the universal tells it points back to in
  `design-taste-frontend` Section 9) and Section 11 (Pre-flight Check).

Neither rubric lives in this file. If a future change to either generation
skill isn't reflected here, that's expected — this skill has no rubric of
its own to fall out of sync.

## 3. What this review adds beyond the generation-time checklist

The generation-time skills already cover design-system consistency, states,
hierarchy, accessibility, i18n, and gamification ethics in detail — re-read
their checklists rather than re-deriving these from scratch. What this
review step adds on top, because it's only checkable with fresh eyes on the
finished artifact rather than during generation:

- **Cross-check against the spec, not just the checklist.** Every
  acceptance criterion in `spec/user-stories.md` that has a UI component
  should be checkable by looking at the screen, not just inferred from
  reading the code or trusting the implementer's self-report.
- **Cross-check against sibling screens.** For product UI, confirm this
  screen actually matches the design system, spacing scale, and radius the
  rest of the app already uses — not just that it followed the rubric in
  isolation. A screen can pass every item on `design-taste-product`'s
  checklist and still look like a different app if nobody compared it side
  by side with an existing screen.
- **Adversarial re-check of anything the implementer flagged as
  ambiguous or skipped.** If the implementation notes mention a state,
  a11y pass, or i18n check that was deferred or assumed, verify it directly
  rather than accepting the note as sufficient.

## 4. Look at it, don't just read the code

If a browser/screenshot tool is available in this environment (e.g. a
Playwright-based skill), render the actual screen and capture a screenshot
before judging anything above — code-pattern checks catch a missing
`aria-label` but not real visual overlap, truncated text, or a contrast
ratio that only fails against the actual rendered background. If no such
tool is available here, say so explicitly in the report rather than
silently skipping the visual pass.

## 5. Record

```markdown
# UI Review Report: <Feature Title>

**Surface(s) reviewed**: <landing | product UI | mixed>
**Rubric(s) applied**: <design-taste-frontend §9/§14 | design-taste-product §10/§11 | both>
**Screenshot pass**: <done | skipped — no browser tool available>
**Result**: PASS | FAIL

| Area | Finding | Severity |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
```

Append to `implementation/ui-review-report.md`. If this feature is also
going through `implementation-orchestrator`'s generic Stage 4 review, this
report is that stage's UI-specific input, not a separate gate — a FAIL here
fails the overall slice review and routes through the same scoped fix loop
(Stage 5), not a parallel one.

## 6. Hand off

- **PASS** → tell the user the UI slice cleared review; if running inside
  `implementation-orchestrator`, this feeds Stage 4's overall PASS/FAIL.
- **FAIL** → list findings ranked by severity and stop — do not fix the code
  from inside this skill. Route each finding back to whichever slice
  produced it, the same way `spec-validator` routes issues back to
  `spec-writer` rather than editing the spec in place.

## Exit checklist

- [ ] Surface type determined and the correct owning skill identified —
      landing/marketing to `design-taste-frontend`, product UI to
      `design-taste-product`, never both applied where only one fits
- [ ] The owning skill's checklist read fresh this run, not from memory or a
      stale copy
- [ ] Findings cross-checked against the actual spec (`spec/user-stories.md`)
      and, for product UI, against sibling screens already shipped — not
      just re-confirmed from the checklist in isolation
- [ ] A real screenshot pass attempted where a browser tool exists; its
      absence is stated explicitly, never silently skipped
- [ ] This skill made no code edits — findings routed back to the owning
      slice, not fixed in place
- [ ] `implementation/ui-review-report.md` updated
