# Handover — BA Domain Baseline Sign-Off

> [!NOTE]
> **NOT to be confused with `handoff`:**
>
> - `handover` (this skill) = **Control Plane** (Stage 8 of BA Pipeline) formal sign-off gate for the Domain Decision Baseline before coding begins.
> - `handoff` (`.agents/skills/productivity/handoff`) = **Data Plane** session compactor for transferring active mental state and next steps to another agent context.

Phase 3, Stage 8 — the final gate. Nothing in this pipeline authorizes
writing implementation code; that authorization is what this skill grants,
and only after every upstream checklist is green.

## 1. Confirm the exit gate

Before doing anything else, verify against `validation-report.md` and every
upstream file:

- [ ] Problem statement and success metrics clearly defined (Stage 2)
- [ ] AS-IS, GAP, TO-BE documented — Full Feature only (Stage 3)
- [ ] All required pillars modeled without silent assumptions (Stage 4)
- [ ] MoSCoW complete with explicit Won't-Have (Stage 5)
- [ ] Contradiction scan passed with zero unresolved conflicts (Stage 5)
- [ ] Every user story has testable Given-When-Then acceptance criteria
      (Stage 6)
- [ ] Spec validation passed, or failures explicitly accepted (Stage 7)

If any box is unchecked, stop and go back to the owning stage — do not sign
off a baseline with open items, even under time pressure. If the user
insists on proceeding anyway, log it exactly like `spec-validator` does:
an explicit accepted gap with their reasoning, not a silent skip.

## 2. Sign off the baseline

Update `baseline.md`:

```markdown
**Status**: SIGNED-OFF
**Version**: 1.0
**Signed off by**: <user, date>
```

From this point, `baseline.md` and the `spec/` documents are locked as
written. Any further scope change is a **new** version, not an edit to the
signed-off one — see §4.

## 3. Produce the handover brief

A short, dev-facing summary (not a re-statement of the full spec — link to
it):

```markdown
# Handover Brief: <Feature Title>

**Baseline version**: 1.0 (signed off <date>)
**Spec documents**: spec/SRS.md, spec/user-stories.md [, BRD.md, PRD.md]
**Traceability matrix**: traceability-matrix.md

## What's being built

<2-3 sentences>

## What's explicitly out of scope

<from the MoSCoW Won't-Have list>

## Known accepted risks/gaps

<from validation-report.md and 04-risk-register.md, if any>

## Next step

Invoke `speckit-specify` (or hand to the dev team) to generate
`.specify/features/<feature-slug>/spec.md` implementation artifacts.
```

## 4. Change management after sign-off

If new information surfaces after handover that changes scope or a business
rule:

- Don't edit the signed-off `baseline.md` section in place.
- Append a new `CHANGELOG.md` entry (e.g. `v1.1 — <date> — <what changed and
why>`), and route the actual change through whichever upstream stage owns
  it (a new business rule → `domain-modeling`; a new risk →
  `risk-contradiction-scanner`; a requirement wording fix →
  `spec-writer` → `spec-validator` again).
- Bump `baseline.md`'s version once the change is itself validated — the
  baseline is always either the last signed-off version or a draft of the
  next one, never a silently-edited hybrid.

## Exit checklist

- [ ] Full exit gate from §1 confirmed, all boxes checked or explicitly
      accepted
- [ ] `baseline.md` marked `SIGNED-OFF` with a version number
- [ ] Handover brief written and links to the real documents rather than
      duplicating them
- [ ] User explicitly told what's next (who/what receives the handoff)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated with the sign-off entry
